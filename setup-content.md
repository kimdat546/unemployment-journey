Title: Welcome to My Unemployment Journey
Slug: welcome-to-my-journey
Content: 
    Today I'm starting something I never thought I'd do - publicly documenting my unemployment experience. 

    After [X] months of being unemployed, I realized that while there are tons of "how to find a job" resources, there aren't enough places that acknowledge the real emotional toll this takes.

    This blog will be my honest account of:
    - The daily struggles and victories
    - Mental health challenges  
    - Job search frustrations
    - Small wins worth celebrating
    - Resources that actually help

    If you're going through something similar, know that you're not alone. This is temporary, even when it doesn't feel like it.
